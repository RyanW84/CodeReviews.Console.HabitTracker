This is a Habit Tracker, an app that can help the user log their habits.

In this particular implementation, the habits are logged by quantity and not time.

Things I have learned:
1) How to connect to a database
2) Perform queries using Sqlite
3) Review the DB and entries using DBrowser
4) Spectre Menu

I have used Spectre Menu for the first time and really like how easy it is to use, and how good it looks.


1) How to add an entry:
(I) Choose Add Record

(II) Fill in the requested information (or press 0 to go back to the Main Menu)
