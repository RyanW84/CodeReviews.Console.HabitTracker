This is a Habit Tracker, an app that can help the user log their habits.

In this particular implementation, the habits are logged by quantity and not time.

Things I have learned:
1) How to connect to a database
2) Perform queries using Sqlite
3) Review the DB and entries using DBrowser
4) Spectre Menu

I have used Spectre Menu for the first time and really like how easy it is to use, and how good it looks.


1) How to add an entry:
I) Choose Add Record
![{45ABBFFA-24B4-44CE-B395-1664978A9A4A}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85515b2d-2fe5-43d4-831e-9a68000d809e)
   
II) Enter The date: 
![{BFFA082C-CC75-435A-AFDE-0EBEC139AC5B}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bffb27a-3570-4507-8dd9-b9a68e51b4f0)
